junk charts challenge
---------------------

introduction
============

this is a chart comparing job losses in recessions since 1948.

it's built using [d3](d3js.org) and [crossfilter](square.github.io/crossfilter).

history
=======

In a [post](http://andrewpwheeler.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-junk-charts-challenge-remaking-a-great-line-chart-in-spss/)
on his blog Andrew Wheeler built some charts as a response
to Kaiser Fung's [comments](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2013/02/remaking-a-great-chart.html)
on his blog about remaking the [original chart](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2013/04/march-employment-report-88000-jobs-76.html)
posted on Calculated Risk.

Kaiser's assertion was that it was easier to make such a chart in
Excel than using statistical software.  Andrew responded with a
demonstration of how it could be done in SPSS.

Kaiser [observed](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2013/03/the-state-of-charting-software.html)
several limitations with the implementation posted.

I personally observed a limitation: it wasn't D3.
